# Pecacheu's Math Solver 3000
Welp this basically started out as a joke when I told my friends "Bet I can just write a program that'll do my math homework for me."

But while still a single-file Node.js program with no depends, at this point it's starting to get complex enough that I could use some version management, so here we are lol.

Btw any formulas in here are 100% figured out by my dumb Rai butt as I read through my textbooks, so accuracy is *not* guaranteed, but I do test things with as many weird examples as I can come up with. (Yeah... At this point you could say it's more work than just doing my homework, and you'd be right! But c'mon where's the fun in that?)
